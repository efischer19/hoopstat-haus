# JSON at Bronze Level: Storage Format Strategy

## Executive Summary

This plan analyzes the feasibility and approach for switching the bronze layer storage format from Apache Parquet to JSON, as suggested in consideration of ADR-014. The proposal aims to reduce complexity in the bronze layer and significantly improve debugging capabilities for daily ingestion issues, while preserving the Parquet format for silver layer and beyond where structured data processing benefits are most valuable.

Current analysis shows this change is technically feasible with moderate implementation complexity. The switch would eliminate the need for complex schema flattening at ingestion time, provide human-readable debugging capabilities, and maintain full API response fidelity. However, it requires careful consideration of storage costs, migration strategy, and downstream processing implications.

## High-Level Implementation Strategy

### 1. Storage Format Transition Approach

**Current State (Parquet Everywhere):**
```
NBA API → Raw JSON → Schema Flattening → Parquet → Bronze S3
                        ↓
                  Complex flattening logic
                  Schema enforcement 
                  Debugging requires special tools
```

**Proposed State (JSON at Bronze, Parquet from Silver):**
```
NBA API → Raw JSON → Minimal Validation → JSON → Bronze S3
                                            ↓
Bronze JSON → Schema Processing → Parquet → Silver S3
                    ↓
              Structured transformation
              Schema enforcement
              Data quality validation
```

### 2. Technical Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Parallel Storage System**
- Implement JSON storage alongside existing Parquet storage
- Run both systems in parallel for validation period (2-4 weeks)
- Compare data integrity, storage costs, and processing performance
- Use feature flags to control which storage system is primary

**Phase 2: Bronze Layer Migration**
- Update bronze ingestion pipeline to write JSON as primary format
- Maintain Parquet as backup during transition period
- Migrate historical bronze data to JSON format in background process
- Update silver layer processing to read from JSON bronze sources

**Phase 3: Full Transition and Cleanup**
- Remove Parquet storage from bronze layer
- Update ADRs to reflect new storage strategy
- Cleanup legacy bronze Parquet files after validation period
- Update documentation and monitoring systems

### 3. Storage Organization Strategy

**New Bronze Layer Structure:**
```
s3://hoopstat-haus-bronze/
├── raw-json/
│   ├── schedule/date=2024-01-15/
│   │   ├── nba-api-response.json
│   │   └── metadata.json
│   ├── box_scores/date=2024-01-15/game_id=123456/
│   │   ├── nba-api-response.json

├── quarantine/
│   └── failed-validations/date=2024-01-15/
└── ingestion-logs/
    └── run-metadata/date=2024-01-15/
```

**JSON Schema Strategy:**
- Store raw API responses with minimal transformation
- Maintain separate metadata.json files for ingestion context
- Use JSON Lines format for collections to enable streaming processing
- Implement light validation without schema enforcement

### 4. Data Processing Pipeline Changes

**Bronze Layer Simplification:**
- Remove complex flattening logic from ingestion pipeline
- Replace with simple JSON validation and storage
- Preserve complete API response structure and metadata
- Add lightweight data quality checks without schema enforcement

**Silver Layer Enhancement:**
- Move schema processing and flattening to silver layer
- Implement robust JSON-to-Parquet transformation pipeline
- Add comprehensive data validation and quality checks
- Maintain current Parquet optimization for analytical workloads

**Gold Layer (Unchanged):**
- Continue using Parquet for pre-computed aggregations
- Maintain current partitioning and optimization strategies
- No changes required to MCP server integration points

### 5. Migration and Deployment Strategy

**Backwards Compatibility Approach:**
- Implement feature toggle system for storage format selection
- Support reading from both JSON and Parquet sources in silver layer
- Enable gradual rollout with easy rollback capabilities
- Maintain data lineage tracking across format transition

**Zero-Downtime Migration:**
- Deploy new JSON storage system without disrupting current operations
- Run parallel ingestion for validation period
- Switch primary ingestion source after validation
- Background process for historical data format conversion
