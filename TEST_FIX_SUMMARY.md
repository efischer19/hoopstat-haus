# Test Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The E2E testing framework tests were failing in CI with connection errors because they were trying to connect to a Localstack S3 endpoint at `http://localhost:4566` that wasn't running during the test execution.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing Localstack**: Tests required a running Localstack instance but were executed in isolation
2. **Datetime Serialization**: JSON serialization failed when mock data contained datetime objects

## Solution
Modified the E2E testing framework to use **moto** (AWS service mocking library) for unit tests instead of requiring a live Localstack instance:

### Changes Made

1. **Updated S3TestUtils to support moto**:
   - Modified constructor to accept `None` for `endpoint_url` (moto doesn't need custom endpoints)
   - Updated client initialization to handle both Localstack and moto modes

2. **Added moto integration to tests**:
   - Added `moto` dependency to `pyproject.toml`
   - Updated test fixtures to use `mock_aws()` context manager
   - Modified test setup to use `endpoint_url=None` for moto

3. **Fixed datetime serialization**:
   - Added `DateTimeEncoder` class that converts datetime objects to ISO format
   - Updated `put_object` method to use custom JSON encoder

### Files Modified
- `libs/hoopstat-e2e-testing/hoopstat_e2e_testing/s3_utils.py`
- `libs/hoopstat-e2e-testing/tests/test_s3_utils.py` 
- `libs/hoopstat-e2e-testing/tests/test_pipeline_runner.py`
- `libs/hoopstat-e2e-testing/pyproject.toml`

## Result
- ✅ All 16 E2E tests now pass without requiring external services
- ✅ Tests can run in CI/CD pipelines without Docker dependencies  
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with Localstack for integration testing
- ✅ All other library tests continue to pass (37 hoopstat-mock-data, 81 hoopstat-data)

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Use moto for isolated testing without external dependencies
- **Integration Tests**: Still support Localstack for full E2E pipeline validation
- **Flexible Architecture**: Same code works with both moto and Localstack based on configuration
