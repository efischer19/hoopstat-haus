# NBA 2024-2025 Season Data Backfill Strategy

## Executive Summary

This plan defines a comprehensive strategy for executing a one-time data backfill to populate the Hoopstat Haus data lakehouse with NBA statistics from the 2024-2025 season. The backfill will be implemented as a containerized, resumable application that respectfully interacts with the NBA API while building a foundational dataset for the current season, with architecture designed for future expansion to historical seasons.

The strategy emphasizes reliability, observability, and alignment with our existing architectural decisions including the medallion data architecture, NBA API data source (ADR-013), Parquet storage format (ADR-014), and AWS S3 infrastructure (ADR-009).

## Scope and Data Coverage

### Season Range
- **Target Season**: 2024-2025 (current season)
- **Future Expansion**: Architecture designed to support historical seasons 1976-77 through present when needed
  - *Note*: Reliable play-by-play data only available after ~1996; pre-1996 seasons limited to box-score statistics
- **Estimated Records**: ~1,300 regular season games + ~80 playoff games

### Data Types for Backfill
1. **Game Metadata**: Game dates, teams, venues, officials
2. **Box Score Statistics**: Traditional and advanced player/team statistics  
3. **Play-by-Play Data**: Detailed game events and sequences (confirmed included)
4. **Player Information**: Current rosters, biographical data, season affiliations
5. **Team Information**: Current team details and active roster data

### API Endpoints (nba-api)
- `leaguegamefinder.LeagueGameFinder()` - Game discovery by season
- `boxscoretraditionalv2.BoxScoreTraditionalV2()` - Traditional box scores
- `boxscoreadvancedv2.BoxScoreAdvancedV2()` - Advanced statistics
- `playbyplayv2.PlayByPlayV2()` - Play-by-play events
- `commonplayerinfo.CommonPlayerInfo()` - Player biographical data
- `teaminfocommon.TeamInfoCommon()` - Team information

## Execution Strategy

### Containerized Application Architecture

The backfill will be implemented as a standalone Docker application optimized for long-running batch execution:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile structure
FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY src/ ./src/
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "-m", "src.backfill_runner"]
```

### Parameter Configuration

The application will accept configuration through environment variables and command-line arguments:

```bash
# Basic execution
docker run hoopstat-backfill \
  --start-season 2024-25 \
  --end-season 2024-25 \
  --s3-bucket hoopstat-haus-bronze \
  --state-file-path s3://hoopstat-haus-bronze/backfill-state/ \
  --rate-limit-seconds 5

# Resume from checkpoint
docker run hoopstat-backfill \
  --resume-from-checkpoint \
  --state-file-path s3://hoopstat-haus-bronze/backfill-state/
```

### Execution Modes

1. **Current Season Mode**: Process 2024-2025 season data
2. **Incremental Mode**: Process specific date ranges within the season
3. **Resume Mode**: Continue from last successful checkpoint
4. **Validation Mode**: Verify data integrity without re-downloading
5. **Dry Run Mode**: Simulate execution for testing and planning

### Resource Requirements

- **Memory**: 2GB minimum, 4GB recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB local working space for temporary files
- **Network**: Stable internet connection with 1Mbps+ bandwidth
- **Runtime**: Estimated 2-3 days for complete season backfill

## State Management & Resumability

### Checkpoint Architecture

The application maintains detailed state information to enable seamless resumption:

```json
{
  "backfill_id": "20241215-season-2024-25-backfill",
  "start_time": "2024-12-15T10:00:00Z",
  "last_checkpoint": "2024-12-16T14:30:00Z",
  "current_season": "2024-25",
  "current_date": "2024-12-16",
  "completed_seasons": [],
  "completed_games": {
    "2024-25": ["0022400001", "0022400002", "..."]
  },
  "failed_games": {
    "0022400123": {
      "error": "API timeout",
      "retry_count": 2,
      "last_attempt": "2024-12-16T14:25:00Z"
    }
  },
  "statistics": {
    "total_games_processed": 847,
    "total_api_calls": 3388,
    "total_bytes_stored": "120MB",
    "average_processing_rate": "120 games/hour"
  }
}
```

### State Storage Strategy

- **Primary State File**: Stored in S3 at `s3://hoopstat-haus-bronze/backfill-state/checkpoint.json`
- **Backup Frequency**: Updated every 10 completed games or 5 minutes
- **Local Backup**: Maintained in container for resilience
- **Atomic Updates**: State updates use atomic S3 operations to prevent corruption

### Resume Logic

1. **Startup Check**: Application reads existing state file from S3
2. **Integrity Validation**: Verify last checkpoint data exists in S3
3. **Gap Detection**: Identify any missing data between checkpoints
4. **Smart Restart**: Resume from last verified complete game
5. **Failure Recovery**: Retry failed games with exponential backoff

## Respectful Rate Limiting Strategy

### Primary Rate Limiting

- **Base Rate**: 1 request every 5 seconds (12 requests/minute)
- **Burst Handling**: No burst requests; consistent pacing
- **Implementation**: Token bucket algorithm with strict enforcement
- **Buffer Time**: Additional 0.5-second buffer for network latency

### Adaptive Rate Limiting

The application will monitor API responses and adjust behavior:

```python
class AdaptiveRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_delay = 5.0  # 5 seconds
        self.current_delay = 5.0
        self.consecutive_errors = 0
        
    def adjust_for_response(self, response_time, status_code):
        if status_code == 429:  # Rate limited
            self.current_delay *= 2  # Exponential backoff
        elif status_code == 200 and response_time < 1.0:
            self.current_delay = max(self.base_delay, self.current_delay * 0.95)
```

### Rate Limiting Policies

1. **429 Response Handling**: Immediate exponential backoff (double delay)
2. **Timeout Handling**: Increase delay by 50% for 3 consecutive timeouts  
3. **Server Error Handling**: Pause for 30 seconds on 5xx errors
4. **Success Response**: Gradual return to base rate (5% reduction per success)

### Monitoring and Alerts

- **Rate Tracking**: Log actual request rate every hour
- **Violation Detection**: Alert on any rate limit violations
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response times and error rates
- **Courtesy Metrics**: Monitor NBA API health and adjust accordingly

## Data Flow and S3 Integration

### Data Storage Pattern

The backfill integrates seamlessly with the existing medallion architecture:

```
s3://hoopstat-haus-bronze/
├── historical-backfill/
│   ├── games/season=1976-77/month=10/
│   ├── games/season=1976-77/month=11/
│   ├── box-scores/season=1976-77/month=10/
│   ├── play-by-play/season=1976-77/month=10/
│   └── players/season=1976-77/
├── backfill-state/
│   ├── checkpoint.json
│   ├── daily-progress/date=2024-12-15/
│   └── error-logs/date=2024-12-15/
└── data-quality/
    ├── validation-reports/date=2024-12-15/
    └── completeness-checks/season=1976-77/
```

### File Organization Strategy

**Partitioning Scheme:**
- **Primary**: Season (aligns with NBA structure)
- **Secondary**: Month (enables efficient querying)
- **File Naming**: `{data_type}_{game_id}_{timestamp}.parquet`

**Example File Path:**
```
s3://hoopstat-haus-bronze/historical-backfill/box-scores/
season=1985-86/month=03/
traditional_stats_0021500756_20241215_143022.parquet
```

### Data Quality and Validation

Each stored file includes comprehensive metadata:

```json
{
  "source": "nba-api",
  "endpoint": "boxscoretraditionalv2.BoxScoreTraditionalV2",
  "game_id": "0021500756",
  "game_date": "1986-03-15",
  "season": "1985-86",
  "ingestion_timestamp": "2024-12-15T14:30:22Z",
  "api_response_time_ms": 847,
  "data_quality_score": 0.98,
  "validation_status": "passed",
  "row_count": 26,
  "column_count": 24
}
```

### Concurrent Upload Strategy

- **Batch Size**: Upload in batches of 5 files to optimize S3 performance
- **Parallel Uploads**: Use 3 concurrent upload threads
- **Retry Logic**: 3 retries with exponential backoff for upload failures
- **Compression**: Use Snappy compression for optimal performance (per ADR-014)

## Error Handling & Logging Strategy

### Error Classification

**Transient Errors (Retry-able):**
- Network timeouts (< 30 seconds)
- HTTP 429 (Rate Limited)
- HTTP 502, 503, 504 (Server errors)
- S3 upload failures

**Permanent Errors (Skip and Log):**
- HTTP 404 (Game not found)
- HTTP 403 (Access denied)
- Data validation failures
- Malformed API responses

**Critical Errors (Stop Execution):**
- Authentication failures
- S3 access denied
- Out of disk space
- Invalid configuration

### Retry Strategy

```python
@retry(
    stop=stop_after_attempt(3),
    wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=60),
    retry=retry_if_exception_type((TimeoutError, ConnectionError))
)
def fetch_game_data(game_id):
    # API call implementation
    pass
```

### Comprehensive Logging

**Structured JSON Logging** (aligned with ADR-015):

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-12-15T14:30:22Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "component": "backfill_runner",
  "event_type": "game_processed",
  "game_id": "0021500756",
  "season": "1985-86",
  "processing_time_ms": 2847,
  "api_calls": 4,
  "bytes_stored": 25632,
  "data_quality_score": 0.98
}
```

**Log Levels and Usage:**
- **DEBUG**: Detailed API request/response information
- **INFO**: Game processing progress and milestones
- **WARN**: Retry attempts and degraded performance
- **ERROR**: Failed games and data quality issues
- **CRITICAL**: Application-stopping errors

### Monitoring Integration

**Progress Tracking:**
- Games processed per hour
- API response time trends
- Error rate by error type
- Data quality score distribution
- Storage utilization growth

**Alerting Thresholds:**
- Error rate > 5% for any hour
- API response time > 10 seconds average
- Storage upload failures > 1% 
- Progress stalled > 30 minutes
- Critical errors (immediate alert)

**Dashboard Metrics:**
- Real-time progress visualization
- Historical processing rates
- Error trend analysis
- Data quality heat maps
- ETA calculations
