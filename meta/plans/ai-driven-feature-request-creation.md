# Plan: AI-Driven Feature Request Creation from Planning Documents

**Status:** Planning  
**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Author:** AI Contributor  
**Scope:** Design and implement automated feature request extraction and GitHub issue creation from planning documents

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the challenge of efficiently converting extensive feature ideas contained in planning documents into actionable GitHub issues. The Hoopstat Haus project has accumulated substantial planning documentation containing detailed feature requests, user stories, and implementation specifications across multiple markdown files in the `meta/plans/` directory. 

The solution will implement an AI-driven approach to automatically parse these planning documents, extract structured feature requests, and create properly formatted GitHub issues using the GitHub CLI. This automation will significantly accelerate the transition from planning to execution while maintaining consistency with established repository standards.

This capability directly supports the project's development philosophy by enabling rapid iteration and reducing the overhead of manual issue creation, allowing developers to focus on implementation rather than administrative tasks.

## High-Level Feature Idea

Create an automated system that can parse planning documents in various formats, extract actionable feature requests, and generate GitHub issues with proper formatting, labels, and metadata. The system will handle multiple feature request formats including detailed issue templates, user stories, and implementation plans.

## Goals & Business Value

- **Accelerate Development Velocity:** Reduce time from planning to execution by automating issue creation
- **Maintain Quality Standards:** Ensure generated issues follow repository conventions and include necessary details
- **Reduce Manual Overhead:** Eliminate repetitive administrative work in converting plans to actionable items
- **Improve Consistency:** Standardize issue formatting and metadata across all feature requests
- **Enable Bulk Operations:** Process multiple planning documents efficiently in batch operations
- **Support Iterative Planning:** Make it easy to update and regenerate issues as plans evolve

## High-Level Implementation Strategy

### Core Architecture Principles

1. **Document Parsing Flexibility:** Support multiple markdown formats and feature request structures
2. **GitHub Integration:** Leverage GitHub CLI for robust, authenticated issue creation
3. **Metadata Preservation:** Maintain important context, priorities, and relationships between features
4. **Error Handling:** Provide clear feedback and recovery mechanisms for failed operations
5. **Auditable Operations:** Generate logs and reports of all issue creation activities
6. **Idempotent Operations:** Allow safe re-running without creating duplicate issues

### Technical Approach

**Document Analysis Strategy:**
- Parse markdown files to identify feature request sections using various markers
- Extract structured data including titles, descriptions, acceptance criteria, and technical requirements
- Handle multiple formats: GitHub issue templates, user stories, epic breakdowns, and implementation steps
- Preserve document context and cross-references between related features

**Data Structuring Strategy:**
- Convert extracted feature requests into standardized JSON format
- Include metadata such as source document, priority, complexity estimates, and dependencies
- Support hierarchical relationships (epics â†’ stories â†’ tasks)
- Maintain traceability back to original planning documents

**GitHub Integration Strategy:**
- Use GitHub CLI (`gh issue create`) for authenticated, reliable issue creation
- Apply appropriate labels based on feature type, complexity, and source document
- Set proper assignees, milestones, and project associations
- Handle rate limiting and error recovery for bulk operations

**Validation and Quality Assurance:**
- Validate extracted data against repository standards before issue creation
- Check for duplicate issues using title and content similarity
- Ensure all required fields are populated with meaningful content
- Provide preview capabilities for manual review before creation

### Document Processing Pipeline

```

    â†“ [Parse & Extract]
Feature Request Identification
    â†“ [Structure & Validate]
Standardized JSON Format
    â†“ [Review & Approve]

```

### Implementation Architecture

**Phase 1: Document Parsing Engine**
- Markdown parser with section identification capabilities
- Pattern matching for various feature request formats
- Extraction rules for titles, descriptions, acceptance criteria
- Context preservation for source document traceability

**Phase 2: Data Standardization**
- JSON schema definition for feature request structure
- Transformation rules from various input formats to standardized output
- Validation framework for completeness and quality
- Relationship mapping for dependent features

**Phase 3: GitHub Integration**
- GitHub CLI wrapper with error handling and retry logic
- Label assignment based on feature characteristics and source
- Batch processing capabilities for multiple issues
- Progress tracking and completion reporting

**Phase 4: Quality Assurance**
- Duplicate detection using content similarity analysis

### Feature Request Extraction Patterns

**Pattern 1: Explicit Feature Request Sections**
```markdown
## ðŸŽ¯ ACTIONABLE FEATURE REQUESTS

### Issue 1: Feature Title
```markdown
## Title
feat: descriptive feature title

## Description
Detailed feature description

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific requirement 1
- [ ] Specific requirement 2
```

**Pattern 2: User Story Format**
```markdown
#### User Story X.Y: Story Title
- **As a** user type
- **I want** specific functionality
- **So that** business value
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Requirement 1
  - Requirement 2
```

**Pattern 3: Implementation Task Lists**
```markdown
#### N. Task Title
```
Description of implementation task
Requirements and specifications
```

### GitHub Issue Template Strategy

**Standard Issue Structure:**
```markdown
# {Feature Title}

## Description
{Extracted description with context from source document}

## Acceptance Criteria
{Formatted checklist of requirements}

## Technical Requirements
{Technical specifications and constraints}

## Source Document
- **Plan:** {source document name}
- **Section:** {section reference}
- **Epic/Phase:** {hierarchical context}

## Definition of Done
{Success criteria and completion requirements}
```

**Label Assignment Strategy:**
- `feature`: All feature requests
- `epic`: Large multi-story features
- `frontend`: UI/UX related features
- `backend`: Server/API related features
- `infrastructure`: DevOps/deployment features
- `data`: ETL/analytics related features
- `high-priority`: Critical path features
- `low-complexity`: Quick implementation features

### Error Handling and Recovery

**Parsing Errors:**
- Log problematic sections with context for manual review
- Continue processing other sections when possible
- Generate error reports with specific location information
- Provide suggestions for fixing format issues

**GitHub API Errors:**
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting
- Retry failed requests with different strategies
- Maintain queue of failed issues for manual reprocessing
- Generate detailed error logs with troubleshooting information

**Duplicate Prevention:**
- Check existing issues using title and content similarity
- Maintain local cache of created issues during batch operations
- Provide options for updating existing issues vs. creating new ones
- Generate conflict reports for manual resolution

### Validation Framework

**Content Quality Checks:**
- Ensure all issues have meaningful titles and descriptions
- Validate acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- Check for broken links or references to non-existent documents
- Verify technical requirements are actionable

**Repository Standard Compliance:**
- Follow conventional commit message format for titles
- Include proper issue template sections
- Apply consistent labeling and categorization
- Maintain links to source planning documents

**Completeness Validation:**
- Ensure all extracted features have required metadata
- Validate hierarchical relationships are preserved
- Check that epic/story/task relationships are maintained
- Verify cross-references between related issues

## Risks & Open Questions

### High Priority Risks
