        ## ‚ùó Scope and Constraints
        **IMPORTANT:** The deliverable for this planning request is **documentation ONLY**.
        - **DO NOT** write or modify any application code in the `/apps` directory.
        - **DO NOT** implement CI/CD workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory.
        - The goal of this task is to produce the *plan* that will be used as the input for a future 'Feature Request'. Implementation will happen in a separate pull request.
