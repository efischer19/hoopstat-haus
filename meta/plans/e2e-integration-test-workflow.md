# Plan: End-to-End Integration Test Workflow

**Status:** Planning (Updated to align with infrastructure deployment workflow ADR-017)  
**Date:** 2025-01-18 (Updated: 2025-01-19)  
**Author:** AI Contributor  
**Scope:** Design and specify a comprehensive end-to-end testing strategy for the complete data pipeline (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold â†’ MCP) using GitHub Actions, integrated with established Terraform infrastructure

## ðŸ”„ Recent Updates (January 2025)

This plan has been updated to align with the infrastructure deployment workflow implemented in PR #63, which established:

- **ADR-017**: Infrastructure deployment workflow using Terraform + GitHub Actions
- **GitHub OIDC Authentication**: Secure keyless authentication with AWS IAM roles
- **S3 & ECR Infrastructure**: Production-ready storage and container registry setup
- **Automated Infrastructure Management**: Plan-on-PR, apply-on-merge workflow patterns

The E2E testing strategy now leverages these established patterns rather than creating separate infrastructure, ensuring consistency with production deployment processes and reducing operational complexity.

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the comprehensive end-to-end integration testing strategy for the Hoopstat Haus data lakehouse, validating the complete data flow from raw NBA statistics ingestion through the Medallion Architecture layers (Bronze/Silver/Gold) to final consumption via the MCP server. The testing framework will be implemented as a GitHub Actions workflow that uses mock data and leverages our established Terraform infrastructure (ADR-017) to ensure our disparately developed components integrate seamlessly into a cohesive system.

The solution builds upon the existing infrastructure deployment workflow, extending the established GitHub OIDC + AWS IAM authentication patterns and S3/ECR resource management to support comprehensive testing scenarios. This approach ensures data quality, transformation accuracy, and API functionality while maintaining cost-effectiveness and developer productivity through infrastructure reuse.

The testing strategy aligns with our development philosophy of "Confidence Through Automated Testing" and integrates with our established infrastructure patterns to provide the foundation for safe, continuous deployment of data pipeline components.

## High-Level Implementation Strategy

### 1. Testing Architecture Overview

The end-to-end integration testing framework will validate the complete data pipeline through four distinct stages:

**Stage 1: Bronze Layer Validation**
- Mock NBA API data ingestion simulation
- Raw data format validation (JSON â†’ Parquet conversion)
- Partitioning and metadata enrichment verification
- Error handling and data quality checks

**Stage 2: Silver Layer Transformation Testing**
- Data cleaning and normalization validation
- Schema enforcement and type conversion checks
- Business rule application verification
- Data lineage and audit trail validation

**Stage 3: Gold Layer Aggregation Testing**
- Business metric calculation accuracy
- Performance optimization validation
- Query pattern testing for expected use cases
- Data freshness and update mechanism verification

**Stage 4: MCP Server Integration Testing**
- API endpoint functionality validation
- Data serving accuracy and performance
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Protocol compliance verification

### 2. Infrastructure Testing Strategy

**Local Development Environment:**
- Use Localstack for S3 simulation during development and PR validation
- Containerized testing environment for reproducible results
- Docker Compose orchestration for multi-service testing

**Integration Environment:**
- Leverage existing Terraform infrastructure (ADR-017) for test resource provisioning
- Create test-specific S3 bucket prefixes within existing bucket structure
- Use established GitHub OIDC + AWS IAM authentication pattern
- Integrate with existing infrastructure deployment workflow for resource management

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Extend existing GitHub Actions infrastructure workflow for testing integration
- Matrix testing strategy for different data scenarios and pipeline configurations
- Parallel execution where possible to minimize execution time
- Leverage established AWS authentication patterns (secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID, OIDC roles)

### 3. Mock Data Generation Strategy

**Realistic Test Data:**
- NBA API response simulation with realistic player, team, and game statistics
- Multiple seasons and scenarios (regular season, playoffs, different team configurations)
- Edge cases and error conditions (malformed data, missing fields, rate limiting)

**Data Volume Testing:**
- Scalable mock data generation from minimal datasets to large-scale simulations
- Performance testing with realistic data volumes
- Memory and processing time validation under load

**Deterministic Testing:**
- Seeded random data generation for reproducible test results
- Known expected outcomes for validation assertions
- Version-controlled test datasets for regression testing

### 4. Validation and Assertion Strategy

**Data Quality Validation:**
- Schema compliance checks at each layer
- Data completeness and accuracy verification
- Referential integrity validation across transformations

**Business Logic Testing:**
- Statistical calculation accuracy (averages, percentages, rankings)
- Aggregation correctness across different time periods and groupings
- Custom business rule implementation validation

**Performance Testing:**
- Processing time benchmarks for each pipeline stage
- Memory usage monitoring and optimization validation
- API response time and throughput testing

### 5. Test Isolation and Cleanup

**Environment Isolation:**
- Unique test environment naming to prevent cross-test interference
- Resource tagging for proper identification and cleanup
- Network isolation where applicable

**Cleanup Automation:**
- Automatic resource destruction after test completion
- Cleanup verification to ensure no resource leakage
- Rollback mechanisms for failed cleanup operations

**State Management:**
- Stateless test design where possible
- Clear test data initialization for stateful components
- Cleanup verification between test runs

## Required ADRs

The following ADRs need to be proposed to support the comprehensive e2e testing implementation, building upon the infrastructure decisions in ADR-017:

### 5. **ADR-XXX: CI/CD Testing Integration Strategy**
- **Decision:** How E2E testing integrates with existing infrastructure deployment workflow
- **Context:** Balance comprehensive testing with CI/CD pipeline efficiency while leveraging GitHub OIDC authentication
- **Options:** Separate workflow, extended infrastructure workflow, or triggered sub-workflows

### 6. **ADR-XXX: Integration Test Reporting and Monitoring**

- **Options:** GitHub Actions reporting, external dashboards, or integrated monitoring

## Risks & Open Questions
