## Context

* **Problem:** We need a consistent, reproducible deployment strategy for all applications that works across different environments (development, staging, production) and provides isolation, portability, and scalability.
* **Constraints:** The solution should be industry-standard, support multi-stage builds for optimized production images, integrate well with CI/CD pipelines, and provide consistent runtime environments.

## Decision

We will use **Docker** to containerize all applications in the Hoopstat Haus project.

## Considered Options

1. **Docker (The Chosen One):** Industry-standard containerization platform.
   * *Pros:* Industry standard with vast ecosystem, excellent multi-stage build support, great tooling and integration, consistent environments across dev/staging/prod, efficient resource usage, extensive documentation and community
   * *Cons:* Additional complexity for simple applications, requires Docker knowledge from developers, potential security considerations if not configured properly

2. **Podman:** Docker-compatible container engine.
   * *Pros:* Rootless containers by default, Docker-compatible CLI, no daemon required
   * *Cons:* Less widespread adoption, some compatibility issues with Docker ecosystem tools, smaller community

3. **Native deployment:** Deploy applications directly on host systems.
   * *Pros:* Simpler for very basic applications, no containerization overhead
   * *Cons:* Environment inconsistencies, dependency conflicts, difficult to reproduce issues, complex scaling, no isolation

## Consequences

* **Positive:** Consistent runtime environments eliminate "works on my machine" issues, easy scaling and orchestration capabilities, excellent CI/CD integration, isolation improves security and stability, multi-stage builds enable optimized production images, portable across different cloud providers and environments.
* **Negative:** Additional complexity in development workflow, requires Docker knowledge from team members, slightly increased resource overhead, need to manage container images and registries.
* **Future Implications:** All applications will include Dockerfiles with multi-stage builds for development and production. This enables consistent deployment strategies, easy local development environment setup, and supports future orchestration with Kubernetes or similar platforms. Applications will be designed with containerization in mind from the start.
