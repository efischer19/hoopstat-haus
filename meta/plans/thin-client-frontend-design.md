# Plan: "Thin Client" Frontend Design for Bedrock and MCP Server Integration

**Status:** Planning  
**Date:** 2025-01-18  
**Author:** AI Contributor  
**Scope:** Design and specify a modern, static frontend application that serves as the primary user interface for hoopstat.haus

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the design and implementation strategy for creating a simple "thin client" frontend application that will serve as the primary user interface for the Hoopstat Haus project. The frontend will feature a simple text input interface where users can ask natural language questions about basketball statistics, starting with anonymous access and a single query type to minimize complexity.

The solution will be implemented as a minimal, static web application using contemporary frontend technologies, designed for optimal user experience across devices while maintaining minimal complexity. The architecture emphasizes the "thin client" approach with no client-side state management, leveraging cloud services for heavy computation and data processing.

This frontend represents the MVP demonstration of the Hoopstat Haus value proposition - making basketball analytics accessible through natural language interactions with a simple "enter question, get results" interface.

## High-Level Feature Idea

Create a simple, elegant, and responsive web application that provides a conversational interface for basketball analytics. Users will interact with a clean text input field to ask questions like "How did LeBron James perform in the 2023 playoffs?" or "Compare Stephen Curry's three-point shooting this season to last season." The frontend will handle authentication, request orchestration between Bedrock and the MCP server, and present responses in an intuitive, visually appealing format.

## Goals & Business Value

- **Democratize Basketball Analytics:** Make complex basketball data accessible to coaches, fans, and analysts through natural language
- **Showcase Platform Capabilities:** Demonstrate the end-to-end value of the AI-native data platform through an intuitive user interface
- **Drive User Adoption:** Provide a compelling entry point that encourages exploration and engagement with basketball data
- **Establish Brand Identity:** Create a distinctive, professional web presence for the Hoopstat Haus platform
- **Enable Scalable Growth:** Build a foundation that can accommodate new features and data sources without architectural constraints
- **Minimize Operational Overhead:** Leverage static hosting and serverless architecture for cost-effective scaling

## Risks & Open Questions

### High Priority Risks

#### Risk: Amazon Bedrock Integration Complexity and Cost
- **Description:** Bedrock API integration may be more complex than anticipated, and AI query costs could escalate quickly
- **Impact:** Could delay implementation or make the service financially unsustainable
- **Mitigation:** Research Bedrock API patterns thoroughly, implement query optimization and caching, set up cost monitoring and usage limits, design fallback mechanisms for AI service failures

#### Risk: Anonymous Access and Cost Control
- **Description:** Anonymous access without authentication requires robust rate limiting to prevent cost escalation and service abuse
- **Impact:** Could make the service financially unsustainable or unavailable due to abuse
- **Mitigation:** Implement global system rate limits at API Gateway and Bedrock layers, set up cost monitoring and usage alerts, design query complexity limits

#### Risk: Simple User Interface Expectations
- **Description:** Users may initially expect more complex conversational capabilities than a simple "enter question, get results" interface provides
- **Impact:** Poor user experience if expectations aren't properly set
- **Mitigation:** Design clear interface messaging about capabilities, provide example queries, focus on single query type initially with clear expansion roadmap

#### Risk: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and API Integration
- **Description:** Static hosting may face CORS limitations when integrating with multiple APIs (Bedrock, MCP server)
- **Impact:** Could require proxy services or architecture changes, affecting static hosting benefits
- **Mitigation:** Design API gateway integration patterns, evaluate proxy service options, implement proper CORS configuration, plan for alternative hosting if needed

### Medium Priority Risks

#### Risk: Mobile Performance and Data Usage
- **Description:** AI-powered queries and data visualizations may consume significant mobile data and processing power
- **Impact:** Poor mobile user experience and accessibility issues
- **Mitigation:** Implement progressive loading, data usage warnings, offline caching, responsive optimization for low-power devices

#### Risk: Browser Compatibility and Progressive Enhancement
- **Description:** Modern frontend frameworks may not work well on older browsers used by some basketball community members
- **Impact:** Excluded user segments and reduced accessibility
- **Mitigation:** Define browser support matrix, implement progressive enhancement, test on range of devices, provide fallback experiences

#### Risk: SEO and Content Discoverability
- **Description:** Static application with dynamic AI content may face SEO challenges for content discovery
- **Impact:** Reduced organic discovery and sharing of basketball insights
- **Mitigation:** Implement static page generation for popular queries, design sharing mechanisms, optimize for social media integration

### Open Questions

#### Question: Single Query Type Initial Implementation
- **Question:** Which specific type of basketball query should be the initial focus for MVP implementation?
- **Impact:** Affects initial development scope and user onboarding strategy
- **Investigation Needed:** Identify most common/valuable query patterns from basketball analytics use cases

#### Question: Response Format and Complexity
- **Question:** How should text responses be formatted for optimal readability and user experience?
- **Impact:** Affects user satisfaction and interface design patterns
- **Investigation Needed:** Test different response formats with target users, evaluate mobile readability

#### Question: Rate Limiting Strategy
- **Question:** What are appropriate rate limits for anonymous access to balance cost control with user experience?
- **Impact:** Affects service costs and user adoption
- **Investigation Needed:** Analyze expected usage patterns, benchmark against similar services
