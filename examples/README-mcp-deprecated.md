# MCP Configuration - Deprecated

The `mcp-claude-desktop-config.json.deprecated` file is preserved for reference only.

**Status**: S3 Tables/MCP integration is out of scope for v1 per [ADR-028](../meta/adr/ADR-028-gold_layer_final.md).

S3 Tables infrastructure has been removed from the project. For v1, the Gold layer will serve public JSON artifacts via standard S3 GET requests instead of MCP/S3 Tables.

See the current architecture in [ADR-028](../meta/adr/ADR-028-gold_layer_final.md).
