# Plan: Python Library Code Sharing Infrastructure

**Status:** Planning  
**Date:** 2025-01-16  
**Author:** AI Contributor  
**Scope:** Enable shared code libraries between multiple Python applications in the monorepo

## High-Level Feature Idea

As project maintainer, I want to share common code between multiple Python applications following the DRY principle to reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and create consistent implementations across applications.

## Goals & Business Value

- **Eliminate Code Duplication:** Apply DRY principle to shared functionality across Python applications
- **Improve Maintainability:** Centralize common logic for easier updates and bug fixes  
- **Ensure Consistency:** Standardize implementations of common patterns and utilities
- **Accelerate Development:** Enable faster development of new applications through reusable components
- **Reduce Technical Debt:** Prevent divergent implementations of similar functionality
- **Simplify Testing:** Centralize testing of shared functionality rather than testing duplicates

## Epic Breakdown

### Technical Architecture Decisions

**Static-First Approach:** Following the development philosophy, we will favor static dependency resolution and build-time optimization over dynamic loading mechanisms.

**Poetry Integration:** Leverage Poetry's local path dependency support for development workflow while maintaining compatibility with standard package distribution.

**Monorepo Benefits:** Utilize monorepo structure to enable atomic changes across libraries and applications, maintaining consistency through shared tooling and CI/CD.

**Incremental Migration:** Implement libraries incrementally, starting with the most commonly duplicated functionality to provide immediate value.

## Risks & Open Questions

### High Priority Risks

#### Risk: Circular Dependencies Between Libraries
- **Description:** Shared libraries may develop dependencies on each other, creating circular import issues
- **Impact:** Could block development and deployment of applications
- **Mitigation:** Establish clear dependency hierarchy rules, use dependency injection patterns, create interface-based abstractions

#### Risk: Version Compatibility Management Complexity
- **Description:** Managing compatibility between multiple libraries and applications could become complex
- **Impact:** Could slow development velocity and increase maintenance burden
- **Mitigation:** Start with simple versioning strategy, use semantic versioning consistently, implement automated compatibility testing

#### Risk: Breaking Changes in Shared Libraries
- **Description:** Updates to shared libraries could break multiple applications simultaneously
- **Impact:** Could create widespread failures across the system
- **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive testing matrix, use feature flags for breaking changes, establish clear deprecation process

### Medium Priority Risks

#### Risk: Developer Workflow Complexity
