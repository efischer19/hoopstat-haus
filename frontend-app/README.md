# Hoopstat Haus Frontend Application

A simple, static web application that provides a text input interface for basketball analytics questions. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript following the project's simplicity-first philosophy.

## Features

- **Simple Text Input Interface**: Clean, accessible form for asking basketball questions
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: Mobile-first CSS with responsive breakpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in client-side rate limiting for cost control
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network and API issues
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during question processing
- **Example Questions**: Pre-built examples to guide users
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with screen reader support

## Architecture

This frontend follows a **vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript approach** as documented in ADR-019. The design emphasizes:

- **Static-First**: No build process required, can be hosted on any web server
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Zero external libraries or frameworks
- **API-Ready**: Prepared for integration with backend services

## File Structure

## Development

### Local Development

1. Serve the files with any static web server:

```bash
# Using Python (recommended)
cd frontend-app
python -m http.server 8080

# Using Node.js
npx serve .

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8080
```

2. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

### Configuration

The application is configured via the `CONFIG` object in `scripts/app.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  API_BASE_URL: 'https://api.hoopstat.haus',
  MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE: 10,
  REQUEST_COOLDOWN_MS: 6000,
  ENABLE_API_CALLS: false, // Enable when backend is ready
};
```

### API Integration

Currently, the app uses mock responses for development. To enable real API calls:

1. Set `CONFIG.ENABLE_API_CALLS = true` in `app.js`
2. Update `CONFIG.API_BASE_URL` to point to your API endpoint
3. Ensure the API endpoint accepts POST requests to `/api/v1/ask` with the format:

```json
{
  "question": "How did LeBron James perform in the 2023 playoffs?",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-21T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Features

### Rate Limiting

The app implements client-side rate limiting to prevent abuse:
- Maximum 10 requests per minute
- 6-second cooldown between requests
- Visual feedback when limits are reached

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling for:
- Network timeouts (30-second limit)
- HTTP errors (429, 500, 503)
- Connection issues
- API failures

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and descriptions
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion support

### Mobile Optimization

- Mobile-first responsive CSS
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimized typography for small screens
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens

## Deployment

### Static Hosting

This application can be deployed to any static hosting service:

- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Recommended for integration with existing infrastructure
- **Netlify**: Simple drag-and-drop deployment
- **Vercel**: Git-based automatic deployments
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting for open source projects

### CDN Optimization

For production deployment:

1. Minify CSS and JavaScript
2. Enable gzip compression
3. Set appropriate cache headers
4. Use a CDN for global distribution

### Environment Configuration

Update the API endpoint based on environment:

```javascript
// Production
const CONFIG = {
  API_BASE_URL: 'https://api.hoopstat.haus',
  ENABLE_API_CALLS: true,
};

// Development
const CONFIG = {
  API_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:8000',
  ENABLE_API_CALLS: false,
};
```

## Future Enhancements

When the backend API is ready, the following features can be easily added:

- Real-time basketball data analysis
- Response caching for common queries
- User query history (without authentication)
- Data visualization components
- Share functionality for interesting insights
- Advanced query suggestions

## Browser Support

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 70+, Firefox 65+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works in older browsers
- **Feature Detection**: Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Performance

- **Load Time**: < 2 seconds on 3G networks
- **First Paint**: < 1 second
- **Bundle Size**: < 50KB total (HTML + CSS + JS)
- **Lighthouse Score**: 95+ for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices
