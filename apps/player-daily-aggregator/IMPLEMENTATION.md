# Player Daily Statistics Aggregator - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This Lambda function implements the basic player daily statistics aggregation from Silver to Gold layer as specified in issue #129. It follows the project's development philosophy of minimal, surgical changes while adhering to established ADRs.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Daily Aggregation**: Aggregates player game data into daily statistics (points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers)
- **Shooting Percentages**: Calculates FG%, 3P%, and FT% with proper zero-attempt handling
- **Season Cumulative Stats**: Maintains season-to-date statistics by accumulating daily totals
- **Data Validation**: Basic row count and null value validation with detailed error reporting

### ADR Compliance
- **ADR-014 (Parquet Storage)**: All data operations use Parquet format via PyArrow
- **ADR-015 (JSON Logging)**: Structured JSON logs with required `duration_in_seconds` and `records_processed` fields
- **ADR-018 (CloudWatch Observability)**: Integration with CloudWatch log groups and metric filters

### Infrastructure
- **S3 Event Trigger**: Automatically processes new Silver layer data
- **Partitioned Output**: Writes Gold layer data partitioned by season/player_id for optimal query performance
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege access to Silver (read) and Gold (read/write) S3 buckets
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with structured logging

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Silver Layer: s3://hoopstat-haus-silver/player_games/season=YYYY/date=YYYY-MM-DD/
    ↓ [S3 Event Trigger]
Lambda Function: player_daily_aggregator
    ↓ [Aggregation Logic]
Gold Layer: s3://hoopstat-haus-gold/player_daily_stats/season=YYYY/player_id=XXX/
    ↓ [Success/Failure Logging]
CloudWatch Logs + Metrics
```

### Data Flow
1. **Trigger**: S3 ObjectCreated event on Silver layer `.parquet` files
2. **Extract**: Parse S3 event to get season/date, read Silver layer player game data
3. **Transform**: Aggregate daily stats, calculate shooting percentages, update season totals
4. **Load**: Write partitioned Parquet files to Gold layer (daily + season stats)
5. **Validate**: Check data quality and log structured results

### Key Components
- **`aggregations.py`**: Core aggregation logic with pandas operations
- **`s3_utils.py`**: S3 operations handling with proper error management
- **`lambda_handler.py`**: Main orchestration with structured logging
- **Comprehensive Tests**: 32 tests covering all functionality including mocked S3 operations

## Usage

### Deployment
The Lambda function is deployed via Terraform configuration added to `infrastructure/main.tf`. It includes:
- Lambda function with proper IAM roles
- S3 bucket notification for automatic triggering
- CloudWatch log group with appropriate retention
- Lambda permission for S3 to invoke the function

### Monitoring
Structured JSON logs enable:
- Performance monitoring via `duration_in_seconds` field
- Throughput tracking via `records_processed` field
- Error alerting via CloudWatch metric filters
- Correlation tracking via unique `correlation_id`

### Example Log Output
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-27T14:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Player daily aggregation completed successfully",
  "job_name": "player_daily_aggregator",
  "duration_in_seconds": 45.67,
  "records_processed": 150,
  "correlation_id": "agg-abc123ef",
  "daily_partitions_written": 150,
  "season_stats_updated": 150,
  "validation_passed": true
}
```

## Testing

All functionality is thoroughly tested with 32 passing tests:
- Unit tests for aggregation logic
- Mocked S3 operations testing
- Lambda handler integration tests
- Error condition handling
- ADR-015 logging compliance validation

```bash
cd apps/player-daily-aggregator
poetry run pytest -v  # 32 tests passing
```

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for the Silver-to-Gold ETL pattern. Future enhancements could include:
- More complex metrics (PER, advanced analytics)
- Team-level aggregations
- Performance optimizations based on actual usage
- Additional data quality checks
- Real-time alerting integration

The current implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria and technical requirements specified in the issue.
