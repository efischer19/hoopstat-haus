## Context

* **Problem:** With Terraform selected as our Infrastructure as Code tool (ADR-010), we need a secure and reliable strategy for managing Terraform state files. State management is critical for team collaboration, preventing resource conflicts, and ensuring infrastructure changes can be tracked and rolled back safely.
* **Constraints:** Must support team collaboration, provide state locking to prevent concurrent modifications, maintain security for sensitive infrastructure data, enable backup and recovery, integrate with our GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows, and align with our single production environment strategy (ADR-012).

## Decision

We will use **AWS S3 with DynamoDB state locking** for Terraform state management, with state files stored in a dedicated S3 bucket and state locking managed through a DynamoDB table.

## Considered Options

1. **AWS S3 with DynamoDB State Locking (The Chosen One):** Remote state backend using AWS services.
   * *Pros:* Built-in versioning and backup through S3, automatic state locking prevents conflicts, integrates seamlessly with AWS infrastructure, supports team collaboration, encryption at rest and in transit, audit logging through CloudTrail, managed service with high availability
   * *Cons:* Requires initial AWS resources setup (bootstrap problem), dependency on AWS services, potential costs for state storage and operations

2. **Local State Files in Git:** Version control state files alongside code.
   * *Pros:* Simple setup with no external dependencies, version history through Git, easy to understand and debug
   * *Cons:* Security risk exposing sensitive data in version control, no state locking leading to conflicts, merge conflicts with binary state files, violates security best practices for infrastructure state

3. **Terraform Cloud:** HashiCorp's managed Terraform service.
   * *Pros:* Managed service with built-in collaboration features, excellent state management and locking, good integration with version control, comprehensive audit logging
   * *Cons:* Additional service dependency outside AWS ecosystem, potential costs for team usage, vendor lock-in to HashiCorp ecosystem, less control over state storage location

4. **Git with State Encryption:** Encrypted state files stored in version control.
   * *Pros:* Leverages existing Git workflow, encryption protects sensitive data, version history maintained
   * *Cons:* Complex key management for encryption, still prone to merge conflicts, no automatic state locking, operational overhead for encryption/decryption

## Consequences

* **Positive:** Secure state storage with encryption and access controls, automatic state locking prevents team conflicts, built-in versioning and backup through S3, seamless integration with AWS ecosystem and GitHub Actions, audit trail through CloudTrail, scales with project growth, supports disaster recovery scenarios.
* **Negative:** Requires initial setup of AWS resources before Terraform can manage itself (bootstrap challenge), dependency on AWS services for state operations, potential costs for S3 storage and DynamoDB operations, complexity in initial configuration compared to local state.
* **Future Implications:** All Terraform operations will require AWS credentials and network access, state backup and recovery procedures must be established, team members need understanding of remote state concepts, infrastructure changes become trackable and auditable through AWS logging, future multi-environment expansion can leverage the same state management pattern.
