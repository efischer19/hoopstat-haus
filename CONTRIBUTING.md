# Contributing to Hoopstat Haus

First off, thank you for your interest in Hoopstat Haus! I'm excited you're here.

This project is currently in a very early and experimental stage. My primary goal is to use it as a personal learning ground to explore AI-driven software development and build my own skills.

That said, I'm open to collaboration, even if the process looks a little different for now.

## Our Current Development Workflow

To stay true to the project's mission, `hoopstat-haus` follows a specific, AI-assisted workflow:

1.  An **Issue** is created, either by me or a contributor, that clearly defines a bug or a feature.
2.  An **AI assistant** (like GitHub Copilot) is used to generate the code to address the issue. This results in a **Pull Request**.
3.  The PR is then reviewed, tested, and **merged by me**.

This unique process is the core of the experiment.

## How You Can Help Right Now

While I'm not actively seeking code contributions from external developers at this time, there are several incredibly valuable ways you can contribute:

#### üêõ Report Bugs or Suggest Features

This is the most helpful way to contribute. If you find a bug, have an idea for a feature, or think something could be improved, please **[open an issue](https://github.com/efischer19/hoopstat-haus/issues)**! Clear issues are the starting point for the entire AI workflow.

#### üí¨ Provide Feedback

Have thoughts on the project's direction, architecture, or even the AI-driven process itself? Feel free to open an issue to start a discussion. I'd love to hear your perspective.

#### üìñ Improve Documentation

If you find a typo, feel something is unclear in the `README` or other documents, or have a question that could be answered in the docs, please let me know by opening an issue.

## What About Code Contributions?

For now, I'm handling the code generation and merging myself as part of the experiment. This helps me maintain a consistent "voice" in the code and focus on the AI-centric workflow.

As the project matures, this process will likely evolve. Thank you for your understanding!
