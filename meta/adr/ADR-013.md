## Context

* **Problem:** The Hoopstat Haus project needs a reliable, comprehensive, and legally compliant source for NBA basketball statistics and data. This data will serve as the foundation for all analytics, visualizations, and insights generated by the platform.
* **Constraints:** Must be free or low-cost for initial development, provide comprehensive historical and current NBA data, offer programmatic access through a well-documented API, maintain legal compliance with NBA data usage policies, support the project's Python-first development approach, and provide reliable data quality and consistency.

## Decision

We will use the **nba-api Python library** as the primary source for NBA statistics and data ingestion.

## Considered Options

1. **nba-api Python Library (The Chosen One):** Community-maintained Python wrapper for NBA's official statistics endpoints.
   * *Pros:* Free and open-source, comprehensive coverage of NBA statistics including historical data, active community maintenance and updates, Pythonic interface aligning with project stack, well-documented with extensive examples, direct access to official NBA data sources, supports both current season and historical data retrieval
   * *Cons:* Dependent on NBA's unofficial API endpoints which could change, rate limiting requires careful implementation, no official support or SLA guarantees, potential for breaking changes with NBA website updates

2. **Official NBA Stats API (Direct):** Direct integration with NBA's statistics endpoints.
   * *Pros:* Most authoritative data source, comprehensive historical and current data, real-time updates during games
   * *Cons:* No official documentation or SDK, endpoints subject to change without notice, requires reverse engineering of API calls, rate limiting and access restrictions, complex authentication and request formatting, high maintenance overhead

3. **Sports Data Commercial APIs (e.g., SportsRadar, ESPN API):** Paid third-party sports data providers.
   * *Pros:* Official support and SLA guarantees, comprehensive data including advanced metrics, reliable uptime and performance, well-documented APIs with SDKs
   * *Cons:* Significant cost for comprehensive data access, contradicts project's principle of cost-effective development, potential vendor lock-in, may include data beyond project scope

4. **Web Scraping NBA Website:** Direct scraping of NBA.com statistics pages.
   * *Pros:* Access to all publicly available data, no API rate limits, free access to official data
   * *Cons:* Violates NBA's terms of service, brittle and maintenance-heavy, potential legal issues, poor data structure requiring extensive parsing, high risk of breaking with website changes

## Consequences

* **Positive:** Enables rapid development with comprehensive NBA data access, aligns with Python-first development philosophy, provides access to both historical and current statistics, active community support for troubleshooting and updates, enables development of rich basketball analytics features, maintains legal compliance with NBA data policies.
* **Negative:** Dependency on unofficial API endpoints introduces some stability risk, requires implementation of proper rate limiting and error handling, potential for breaking changes requires monitoring and maintenance, limited to NBA data only (no other leagues without additional integrations).
* **Future Implications:** All data pipeline components must be designed to handle nba-api's data structures and response formats, rate limiting strategies become critical for production deployment, monitoring and alerting needed for API availability and response times, future expansion to other sports leagues will require additional data source integrations.
