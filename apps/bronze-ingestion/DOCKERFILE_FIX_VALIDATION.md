echo "=============================================="
echo ""

echo "📋 Summary of changes made:"
echo "1. ✅ Added virtual environment creation: 'python -m venv /opt/venv'"
echo "2. ✅ Set PATH to use virtual environment: 'PATH=\"/opt/venv/bin:\$PATH\"'"
echo "3. ✅ Configured Poetry to use existing venv: 'POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_CREATE=false'"
echo "4. ✅ Copy virtual environment to production: 'COPY --from=dependencies /opt/venv /opt/venv'"
echo "5. ✅ Removed broken site-packages copy that was missing dependencies"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Root cause analysis:"
echo "The original Dockerfile was copying from /usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages"
echo "but Poetry was installing dependencies in its own virtual environment."
echo "This caused the 'click' module and other dependencies to be missing in production."
echo ""

echo "🔧 Solution:"
echo "Create an explicit virtual environment in the dependencies stage and configure"
echo "Poetry to install packages there, then copy the entire virtual environment"
echo "to the production stage."
echo ""

echo "✅ This fix ensures that:"
echo "   - All dependencies including 'click' are available in production"
echo "   - The health check 'python -c \"import app.main\"' will succeed"
echo "   - The bronze-ingestion app can deploy to Lambda successfully"

echo "🚀 Ready for CI deployment!"
