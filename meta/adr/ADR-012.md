## Context

* **Problem:** The Hoopstat Haus project needs a clear strategy for managing different environments during development and deployment. Traditional multi-environment approaches (dev/staging/production) can add significant complexity and cost, while still allowing integration issues to surface late in the development cycle.
* **Constraints:** Must balance simplicity with reliability, minimize infrastructure costs for a growing project, support confident deployments to production, enable effective testing and validation, align with the project's philosophy of simplicity and static-first design, and support the small team size and development velocity.

## Decision

We will use a **single production environment strategy with local and branch-based development**, where developers work locally and in feature branches, with direct deployment to production after successful automated testing and code review.

## Considered Options

1. **Single Production Environment with Local/Branch Development (The Chosen One):** Simplified environment model.
   * *Pros:* Minimal infrastructure complexity and cost, forces robust automated testing and review processes, eliminates environment drift between staging and production, faster development cycle without environment promotion delays, aligns with project simplicity principles, encourages comprehensive local testing
   * *Cons:* Higher risk of production issues without staging buffer, requires excellent test coverage and review processes, debugging production issues may be more challenging, less suitable for complex integration scenarios

2. **Traditional Multi-Environment (Dev/Staging/Production):** Separate environments for each development stage.
   * *Pros:* Lower risk of production issues through staged testing, ability to test integration scenarios in staging, familiar pattern for most developers, easier debugging with production-like staging environment
   * *Cons:* Significantly higher infrastructure costs and complexity, environment drift between staging and production, slower development velocity due to promotion delays, additional operational overhead for multiple environments, contradicts project simplicity goals

3. **Blue-Green Deployment with Two Production Environments:** Alternating production environments for zero-downtime deployments.
   * *Pros:* Zero-downtime deployments, easy rollback capabilities, ability to test in production-identical environment, reduced deployment risk
   * *Cons:* Doubles infrastructure costs, adds significant operational complexity, overkill for current project size and requirements, requires sophisticated traffic routing and monitoring

## Consequences

* **Positive:** Reduced infrastructure costs and operational complexity, faster development and deployment cycles, eliminates environment-specific configuration issues, forces investment in robust automated testing and review processes, aligns with project principles of simplicity and efficiency, encourages developers to think about production readiness early.
* **Negative:** Higher dependency on automated testing quality and coverage, increased importance of thorough code review processes, potential for more production incidents without staging buffer, requires discipline in local testing and validation, debugging production issues requires good observability tooling.
* **Future Implications:** All development must include comprehensive local testing strategies, automated testing suite becomes critical infrastructure requiring ongoing investment, code review processes must include production readiness assessment, monitoring and observability become essential for early issue detection, future growth may require evolution to more complex environment strategies.
