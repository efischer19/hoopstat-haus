        ## ‚ùó Scope and Constraints
        **IMPORTANT:** The deliverable for this planning request is **documentation ONLY**.
        - **DO NOT** write or modify any application code in the `/apps` directory.
        - **DO NOT** implement CI/CD workflows in the `.github/workflows` directory.
        - The goal of this task is to produce the *plan* that will be used as the input for future 'Feature Requests'. 
        
        ## üéØ Expected Output Format
        The plan should conclude with a **"Next Steps: Feature Requests for Implementation"** section containing copy-paste ready GitHub issue templates. This is the most valuable deliverable - actionable next steps that can be immediately converted to implementation tasks.
        
        **Example Format:**
        ```
        ### Phase 1: Foundation
        **1. Create Authentication System**
        ```
        Title: Implement OAuth2 authentication with GitHub
        Description: Set up user authentication using OAuth2 flow with GitHub integration
        Deliverables: Login/logout functionality, user session management, protected routes
        ```
        
        **2. Set up Database Schema**
        ...etc
        ```
        
        Implementation will happen in separate pull requests using these feature requests as specifications.
