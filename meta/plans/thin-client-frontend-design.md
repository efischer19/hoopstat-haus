# Plan: "Thin Client" Frontend Design for Bedrock and MCP Server Integration

**Status:** Planning  
**Date:** 2025-01-18  
**Author:** AI Contributor  
**Scope:** Design and specify a modern, static frontend application that serves as the primary user interface for hoopstat.haus

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the design and implementation strategy for creating a "thin client" frontend application that will serve as the primary user interface for the Hoopstat Haus project. The frontend will feature a simple text input interface where users can ask natural language questions about basketball statistics, orchestrating seamless communication between users, Amazon Bedrock (for AI/LLM capabilities), and our backend MCP server (for data access).

The solution will be implemented as a modern, static web application using contemporary frontend technologies, designed for optimal user experience across devices while maintaining minimal complexity. The architecture emphasizes the "thin client" approach with minimal client-side logic, leveraging cloud services for heavy computation and data processing.

This frontend represents the primary user-facing demonstration of the Hoopstat Haus value proposition - making advanced basketball analytics accessible to non-technical users through natural language interactions, showcasing the power of our AI-native data platform.

## High-Level Feature Idea

Create a simple, elegant, and responsive web application that provides a conversational interface for basketball analytics. Users will interact with a clean text input field to ask questions like "How did LeBron James perform in the 2023 playoffs?" or "Compare Stephen Curry's three-point shooting this season to last season." The frontend will handle authentication, request orchestration between Bedrock and the MCP server, and present responses in an intuitive, visually appealing format.
