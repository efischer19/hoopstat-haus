## Context

The Hoopstat Haus project requires a simple static frontend application foundation that provides a text input interface for basketball questions without authentication complexity. The frontend needs to be:

- Simple and maintainable with minimal dependencies
- Mobile-responsive for core interface
- Stateless without client-side session management
- Ready for API gateway integration
- Aligned with the project's simplicity-first development philosophy

## Decision

We will implement the initial frontend using vanilla HTML5, CSS, and minimal JavaScript without a frontend framework. This approach follows the "Static Over Dynamic" and "YAGNI" principles from our development philosophy.

### Key Technical Decisions:

1. **No Frontend Framework**: Use vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript for maximum simplicity and minimal dependencies
2. **Static File Structure**: Organize as static files that can be hosted on any web server or CDN
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced features layer on top
4. **Mobile-First Design**: CSS designed with mobile-first responsive approach
5. **Minimal JavaScript**: Only essential JavaScript for form handling and future API integration

## Implementation Details

### File Structure:
```
frontend-app/
├── index.html              # Main application entry point
├── assets/
│   ├── styles.css         # CSS styles with mobile-first design
│   └── favicon.ico        # Basic favicon
├── scripts/
│   └── app.js             # Minimal JavaScript for form handling
└── README.md              # Frontend-specific documentation
```

### Core Features:
- Simple text input interface for basketball questions
- Loading states and error handling
- Mobile-responsive design
- Foundation for API client integration
- Rate limiting preparation

## Rationale

This decision aligns with several key project principles:

1. **Simplicity First**: Vanilla approach eliminates framework complexity and dependencies
2. **Code is for Humans**: Simple HTML/CSS/JS is readable by any web developer
3. **Static Over Dynamic**: No build process or dynamic rendering complexity
4. **YAGNI**: Implement only what's needed for the MVP functionality

The whassat repository demonstrates this approach works well for simple, focused applications.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Zero build process complexity
- No framework dependencies to maintain
- Easy to host on any static hosting platform
- Simple debugging and maintenance
- Fast loading times
- Maximum browser compatibility

### Negative:
- May need to reconsider for complex UI features later
- No built-in state management patterns
- Manual DOM manipulation required
- No component reusability patterns

## Future Considerations

If the application grows in complexity, we can:
- Add a build process for optimization without changing the core approach
- Introduce web components for reusability
- Migrate to a framework while keeping the same static hosting model
- Add TypeScript compilation for type safety

This decision provides a solid foundation that can evolve without breaking the core simplicity principle.
